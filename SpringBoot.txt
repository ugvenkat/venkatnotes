@Component

In Spring Boot, @Component is an annotation used to indicate that a class is a Spring component. Spring components are Java classes that are managed and configured by the Spring IoC (Inversion of Control) container. This annotation is part of the Spring framework's component scanning mechanism, which automatically detects and registers Spring components during the application startup.

When you annotate a class with @Component, it becomes a Spring bean, and the Spring IoC container takes care of its lifecycle and dependency injection. Components annotated with @Component are typically used to represent and manage various parts of the application, such as services, repositories, controllers, and other beans.
Here's a brief example:

import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class MyComponent {

    public void doSomething() {
        // Some functionality
    }
}
In this example, MyComponent is annotated with @Component, indicating that it should be automatically detected and registered as a Spring bean. Later in your application, you can inject and use MyComponent in other classes:

java code
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class MyService {
    private final MyComponent myComponent;
    @Autowired
    public MyService(MyComponent myComponent) {
        this.myComponent = myComponent;
    }

    public void serviceMethod() {
        myComponent.doSomething();
    }
}
Here, MyService is annotated with @Service, which is another specialization of @Component. It uses constructor injection to get an instance of MyComponent and calls its doSomething method.
In summary, @Component is a fundamental annotation in Spring Boot for enabling component scanning and making classes Spring-managed beans.
